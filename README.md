Building StrixFy and myself at the same time.
Every project is a mirror the bugs, the breakthroughs, the patterns.
The mission isn’t perfection, it’s evolution.
It all compounds. I’m not chasing luck, I’m engineering inevitability.

“The magic you’re looking for is in the work you’re avoiding.” — Mel Robbins
